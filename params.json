Used to draw visually pleasing figures. All files get sourced from `diss.tex` at some point.\r\n\r\n-   `LICENCE`: Content with scientific value (i.e. not bare LaTeX code) is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution - NonCommercial - NoDerivatives 2.5 Switzerland License. Read the licence carefully to see what you are allowed to do.\r\n\r\n-   `apacite-mod.bst`: A modified apacite.bst file.

Do not move it out of the downloaded folder, it will not compile correctly.\r\n-   Compile `diss.tex` multiple times.\r\n\r\nlast updated on October 11, 2016 :tada:\r\n",
