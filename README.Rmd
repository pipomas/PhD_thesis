This repository contains my PhD thesis `diss.pdf` as well as all files to reproduce it.

### Prerequisites

* You need [R](https://cran.r-project.org) installed on your system.
* I recommend using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) as editor, as it includes a console, syntax-highlighting, tools for plotting, history, and workspace management.
* Download this repository by clicking on the green «*Clone or download*» button in the top right corner, and [set the downloaded folder as your R working directory](http://rfunction.com/archives/1001).

## Repository content

### `data`
* `base`: This folder includes all raw files of the tasks used.

### Info about the files in this repository will be added soon

last updated on `r format(Sys.Date(), "%B %d, %Y")` :tada:
