<!-- ### Prerequisites for reproducing `diss.pdf` -->
<!-- * You need [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) installed on your system. -->
<!-- * I recommend using [TeXStudio](https://sourceforge.net/projects/texstudio/) as editor, as it comes with an integrated pdf viewer, live inline preview, advanced syntax-highlighting, live checking of references, citations, latex commands, spelling and grammar. -->
<!-- * Download this repository (**not only `diss.tex`**) by clicking on the green «*Clone or download*» button in the top right corner, and open `diss.tex` from within the downloaded folder. Do not move it out of the downloaded folder, it will not compile correctly. -->
<!-- * Compile `diss.tex` multiple times. -->
